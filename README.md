# ASP.NET Core Blank Web Application

If you're not using Visual Studio, it can be tricky to scaffold a new ASP.NET Core project. Eventually, you'll be able to use [`yo aspnet`](https://github.com/OmniSharp/generator-aspnet/issues/601) or [`dotnet new web`](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/2052), but until then, feel free to clone and use this sample empty seed project.

## How to Get Started

```
git clone https://github.com/nbarbettini/dotnet-new-web.git
cd dotnet-new-web/src/WebApplication
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
